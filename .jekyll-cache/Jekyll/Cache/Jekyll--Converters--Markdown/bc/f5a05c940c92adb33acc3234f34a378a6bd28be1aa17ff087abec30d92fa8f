Before this, I was a Ph.D. student at the University of Pennsylvania, where I worked with [Dan Roth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~danroth/) and [Weijie Su](http://stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~suw/index.html). Before that, I received my bachelor's degree from Peking University in 2017. </div>

<p>My research interests include machine learning and natural language processing, with a focus on incidental supervision for natural language understanding, interpretability of deep neural networks, and reasoning in natural language.</p>
