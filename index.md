I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/) and the [Goergen Institute for Data Science](https://www.sas.rochester.edu/dsc/) at the University of Rochester. I obtained my Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 2023, where I worked with [Dan Roth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~danroth/) and [Weijie Su](http://stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~suw/index.html). I received my bachelor's degree from Peking University in 2017.

My research interests include natural language processing and machine learning, with a focus on geometrization approaches towards understanding deep learning, theoretical formulation of reasoning in natural language, and understanding the structure of data through the lens of evaluation.
