I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/) and the [Goergen Institute for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence](https://www.sas.rochester.edu/dsc/) at the University of Rochester. I obtained my Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania, where I worked with [Dan Roth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~danroth/) and [Weijie Su](http://stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~suw/index.html). I received my bachelor's degree from Peking University.

My research interests include natural language processing and machine learning, with a focus on deep learning interpretability, reasoning in natural language, and evaluation of large language models.
